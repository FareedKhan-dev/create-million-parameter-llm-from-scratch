    "Making your own Large Language Model (LLM) is a cool thing that many big companies like Google, Twitter, and Facebook are doing. They release different versions of these models, like 7 billion, 13 billion, or 70 billion. Even smaller communities are doing it too. You might have read blogs or watched videos on creating your own LLM, but they usually talk a lot about theory and not so much about the actual steps and code."

    "\n",
    "In the LLaMA approach, a technique called RMSNorm is employed for normalizing the input of each transformer sub-layer. This method is inspired by GPT-3 and is designed to optimize the computational cost associated with Layer Normalization. RMSNorm provides similar performance to LayerNorm but reduces the running time significantly (by 7%∼64%).\n",

    "\n",
    "Rotary Embeddings, or RoPE, is a type of position embedding used in LLaMA. It encodes absolute positional information using a rotation matrix and naturally includes explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulations. RoPE offers advantages such as scalability to various sequence lengths and decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is achieved by encoding relative positions through multiplication with a rotation matrix, resulting in decayed relative distances — a desirable feature for natural language encoding. Those interested in the mathematical details can refer to the [RoPE paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.09864v4.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to these concepts, the LLaMA paper introduces other significant approaches, including the use of the **AdamW optimizer** with specific parameters, efficient implementations such as the causal [multi-head attention operator](https://facebookresearch.github.io/xformers/components/mha.html) available in the xformers library, and manually implemented backward functions for transformer layers to optimize computation during backward passes.\n",

    "In this notebook, we’ve walked through a step-by-step process on how to implement the LLaMA approach to build your own small Language Model (LLM). As a suggestion, consider expanding your model to around 15 million parameters, as smaller models in the range of 10M to 20M tend to comprehend English better. Once your LLM becomes proficient in language, you can fine-tune it for specific use cases.\n",
